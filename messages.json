Maybe include some examples of each type. I should also make sure the poem flows well and is catchy. Let's start by introducing fish in the ocean and their role as friends. Then describe their behavior, maybe some of them swimming quickly and others feeding on them. I want to highlight their unique features and how they make life easy for those who care. The tone should be warm and inviting, similar to what someone might like to read about fish.\nAlright, I think I have a good structure in mind.

        "text": "Okay, the user wants a C++ program that prints \"Hello World\". I should provide a simple code example that demonstrates this. I'll start by outlining the structure.\n\nFirst, I need to declare an integer variable to hold the message. The message is \"Hello World\". I'll store this in a string, since strings in C++ can be assigned to variables and manipulated easily.\n\nNext, I'll use the std::cout stream to output the message. The format statement for this will be \"%s\", followed by the string we just declared. That way, when we compile, it will print the message on the screen.\n\nI need to include the appropriate headers for this program. C++ requires including <iostream> to use std::cout and std::cin streams. Also, for string handling, I'll include <string>. These include statements are essential to ensure the program compiles without any issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the code should declare an int message, assign it the value \"Hello World\", and then output it using std::cout. Finally, I'll add a \"done!\" message to indicate completion, as per the user's request.\n\nI should also remind the user that this program can be run by compiling and executing it with a suitable compiler. If they need help with a different program, they can provide more details.\n</think>\n\nHere's a simple C++ program that prints \"Hello World\":\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Hello World\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Hello, World!\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo compile and run the program, you'll need a compiler installed on your system. You can run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ng++ Hello World.cxx -o Hello World && ./Hello World\n```\n\nThis will compile the program and run it, printing \"Hello World\" to the console.",
